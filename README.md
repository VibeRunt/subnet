# vhybZ: Crowdsourcing The `Cognitive Core` for Coding Agents

## **Part I: The Executive Thesis**

### **1. Problem: The Crisis of Generic AI**

AI coding tools are creating more work than they save. Developers report spending more time managing AI output than actually coding - hitting the "85% problem" where "your code starts breaking or being rewritten by the very same agent that helped you build it, making it impossible to get to the finish line" ([reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1jbfav8/i_have_zero_coding_experience_and_the_85_problem/)). 

Despite headlines about AI improving developer productivity, "only 6% of engineering leaders have seen a significant productivity boost" from AI coding assistants ([LeadDev](https://leaddev.com/velocity/ai-coding-assistants-arent-really-making-devs-feel-more-productive)). 

The productivity impact is documented: "Over three in four (77%) say AI tools have decreased their productivity and added to their workload" with "Nearly half (47%) of workers using AI say they have no idea how to achieve the productivity gains their employers expect" ([Upwork Study](https://investors.upwork.com/news-releases/news-release-details/upwork-study-finds-employee-workloads-rising-despite-increased-c)).

Foundational models, trained on statistical averages, excel at producing average outcomes. This creates a rising tide of **AI Slop**: functional but soulless code, architecturally generic designs, undifferentiated user experiences.

The underlying issue isn't a technical limitation of LLMs - it's a **market failure**. Thousands of world-class experts possess deep, specialized knowledge in narrow domains (React Server Components, Solidity security patterns, GPU shader optimization). They spend countless hours staying current, but this expertise only benefits their own projects. There's no efficient mechanism to connect high-value, opinionated knowledge with AI coding agents that desperately need context-aware guidance.

### **2. Solution: Multiply Expertise Through Competition**

**vhybZ** creates a decentralized market where domain expertise multiplies its impact through competitive prompt evolution targeting AI coding agents as primary consumers.

**The Simple Flow**: 
- **Input**: AI agent sends a basic prompt like "add authentication to my Next.js app"
- **Output**: Receives an evolved prompt like "Implement NextAuth.js v5 with Prisma adapter using JWT strategy, configure OAuth providers in .env.local, add middleware protection to /app/(protected) routes using Next.js 14 App Router patterns, ensure TypeScript types are properly exported from auth.ts"

We provide the framework (starting with `.vibe` developer tool) for experts to codify their unique development philosophies into specialized AI agents (**Miners**). These Miners compete to evolve basic prompts into expert-level instructions. The best evolved prompts - those that make AI coding agents produce superior code - earn proportional rewards.

**Core Innovation**: The network doesn't generate code - it generates the evolved prompts that make AI coding agents generate *better* code.

Our method builds on recent AI research showing how collaborating agents consistently outperform single models (*"Agents of Change," [Belle et al.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.04651v1), 2025*).

### **3. Why This Matters Now**

The economics are shifting rapidly. AI execution has become commodity - [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com), [Loveable](https://lovable.dev/) and [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) all generate competent code. The differentiator isn't code generation anymore, it's providing the strategic guidance to generate the *right* code.

The cost of maintaining deep expertise is too high for one project but becomes highly profitable when amortized across thousands of AI agents. Each project interaction builds on previous decisions, creating exponentially more valuable context over time. Meanwhile, the Bittensor ecosystem has matured with dedicated subnets for LLM inference (**Apex, SN1**) and decentralized storage (**FileTAO, SN21**).

### **4. Incentive Alignment: Leveraged Expertise**

This isn't passive income - it's **leveraged expertise**. Miners must constantly evolve their strategies or be outcompeted. They're already doing this hard work for their own projects; vhybZ just provides the protocol to monetize that ongoing R&D.

### **5. Ask: Subnet Registration**

Our architecture is validated, our go-to-market plan via the [`.vibe` developer tool](https://github.com/vhybzOS/.vibe) is defined, and the market need is clear. We're seeking **registration for the vhybZ Subnet** to deploy what we believe will be foundational protocol for differentiated AI development.

## **Part II: Tokenomics of $VIBE**

The **$VIBE** token solves a simple problem: how do you pay experts for expertise that AI agents consume? 

Most crypto projects complicate this with governance tokens and speculation mechanisms. We took the opposite approach. $VIBE has one purpose: accessing and incentivizing evolved prompts for AI coding agents. That's it.

Think of it like paying for premium tools, except the "tools" are the accumulated wisdom of thousands of domain experts competing to provide the best guidance to AI systems.

**Here's how the economics work:**

AI platforms and developers need expert prompts for their coding agents, so they buy $VIBE to access the network. The better the evolved prompts, the more AI systems want them. More demand means higher token value, which attracts better experts as miners. Better experts create superior prompts, attracting more AI platforms.

It's a flywheel, but one grounded in real utility rather than speculation.

**The demand comes from three sources:**

First, query fees. This is the primary driver - AI platforms, developer tools, and enterprises must pay $VIBE to receive evolved prompts for their coding agents. We use dynamic pricing based on complexity and miner specialization, plus enterprise bulk purchasing for high-volume AI integrations.

Second, miner stakes. Experts must stake $VIBE proportional to their claimed expertise breadth. A single-domain specialist needs 10,000 $VIBE minimum. Each additional domain costs 1.5x more, incentivizing focus over generalization. Stakes lock for 30 days minimum, creating persistent supply reduction.

Third, validator bonds. Validators stake significantly more to participate in consensus - 100,000 $VIBE minimum. Higher stakes mean higher weight in consensus formation. We slash stakes for malicious behavior or persistent outlier scoring.

**Supply follows Bittensor's standard model:** 41% to miners based on evolved prompt quality, 41% to validators weighted by consensus accuracy, 18% to subnet development for protocol advancement and partnerships. All emissions vest over 7 days to prevent dumping.

For consistent AI platforms, we offer staking-based payment. Stake 50,000+ $VIBE to earn "query credits" from staking rewards - about 10 queries daily for 50k stake. Credits don't accumulate (use them or lose them), creating additional buy pressure from power users who prefer predictable costs.

**Anti-gaming measures are built in:** Miners earning below the 20th percentile for 1000 blocks face stake increases. Inactive miners lose 1% stake daily after 7200 blocks. Validators get slashed up to 10% for malicious behavior. We allocate 5% of development funds for market making.

Conservative projections suggest 10,000 daily AI agent queries at 10 $VIBE average in year one (100,000 $VIBE daily demand), scaling to 100,000 queries at 8 $VIBE average in year two (800,000 daily demand). As demand grows, price appreciation makes mining more attractive, improving quality and justifying higher fees.

$$\text{Token Velocity} = \frac{\text{Daily Query Volume} \times \text{Average Price per Query}}{\text{Circulating Supply}} \times 365$$

## **Part III: Deep Architecture & Mechanics**

### **1. Miner Mechanism: The Evolving Agent as Competitive Specialist**

Miners aren't static prompt templates - they're living systems that must evolve or die.

The core transaction is stateful and context-rich. Miners receive a `(ProjectID, ProjectHistory, CurrentContextBlock)` tuple. The `ProjectHistory` contains the full log of past architectural decisions, retrieved from decentralized storage. The `CurrentContextBlock` has the AI agent's immediate raw prompt plus task-specific context like relevant file snippets and dependencies.

Miners produce an **`EvolvedPrompt`** - a highly specific, expert-infused prompt string that embeds deep domain knowledge, library recommendations, file-specific instructions, and architectural patterns. When fed to any AI coding agent, it produces dramatically superior code.

The reference implementation builds directly on the multi-agent **`AgentEvolver` architecture** from recent research (**Belle et al., 2025, *Agents of Change***). This system uses internal roles like `Analyzer`, `Researcher`, and `Strategizer`, perfectly suited for processing complex, stateful inputs.

Miners use "bid/no-bid" mechanisms. Their internal `Analyzer` first evaluates whether an incoming task matches their specialization. This ensures compute resources aren't wasted on low-confidence tasks, creating an efficient, non-zero-sum market.

```python
# Conceptual Miner Logic based on AgentEvolver model
class EvolvingMiner:
    def __init__(self, domain: str):
        self.analyzer = PatternAnalyzer()
        self.researcher = TechRadarMonitor() # Tracks ecosystem changes
        self.strategizer = PromptGenerator()
        self.domain = domain # e.g., "react_performance", "solidity_security"

    def should_compete(self, task: Task) -> bool:
        # Sophisticated matching based on specialization
        return self.analyzer.evaluate_fit(task.project_history, self.domain) > 0.8

    def generate_evolved_prompt(self, task: Task) -> EvolvedPrompt:
        # The full AgentEvolver pipeline
        patterns = self.analyzer.extract_patterns(task.project_history)
        latest_techniques = self.researcher.get_current_meta(self.domain)
        evolved_prompt = self.strategizer.synthesize_prompt(
            patterns, 
            latest_techniques, 
            task.current_context
        )
        return evolved_prompt

    def evolve(self, market_feedback: List[Score]):
        # Miners must evolve based on performance
        self.strategizer.update_weights(analyze_performance(market_feedback))
```

$$\text{Miner Confidence Score} = \frac{\text{Domain Match Score} \times \text{Historical Performance}}{\text{Competition Factor}}$$

### **2. Validation Mechanism: Lightweight, LLM-as-a-Judge**

Validators orchestrate objective evaluation without heavy local computation.

The workflow is elegant: validators offload expensive evaluation to commodity LLM inference subnets like **Apex (SN1)**. They construct standardized prompts asking the LLM to score evolved prompts against clear rubrics - "Specificity and actionability," "Technical accuracy," "Appropriate library selection," "Context awareness."

The economics work because Apex queries cost ~0.001 TAO while validation rewards are ~0.01 TAO, ensuring 10x margins for sustainable participation.

$$\text{Validator Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Validation Reward} - \text{LLM Query Cost}}{\text{Validation Reward}} = \frac{0.01 - 0.001}{0.01} = 90\%$$

### **3. Fair Play Through Code**

The network self-regulates through transparent, algorithmic mechanisms.

Miner scores get finalized via **Interquartile Mean (IQM)** of validator scores, robustly rejecting malicious evaluations. Similarity detection splits rewards when `cosine_similarity(prompt_A, prompt_B) > 0.95`, making plagiarism unprofitable. Validators consistently outside consensus automatically lose stake weight. Generalists get outcompeted by specialists in every domain.

$$\text{Consensus Score} = \text{IQM}(\text{Validator Scores}) = \frac{Q_3 + Q_1}{2}$$

### **4. Phased Roadmap**

**Phase 1: MVP & Go-to-Market (Months 1-2)**

Push the [`.vibe` developer tool](https://github.com/vhybzOS/.vibe) to public as the pioneering CLI for context engineering. Deploy a stateless MVP focused on React/shadcn component architecture, proving specialized Miners consistently outperform generalists. Products like [Loveable](https://loveable.dev) and [Bolt](https://bolt.new) already demonstrate feasibility; the `.vibe` tool dramatically reduces the barrier to creating similar effects.

**Phase 2: The Memory Advantage (Months 2-3)**

Activate the stateful network by integrating FileTAO for `ProjectHistory`, proving context-aware strategies yield superior results.

**Phase 3: The Protocol Ecosystem (Months 4-6)**

Become the essential cognitive core by integrating Model Context Protocol (MCP) for dynamic capability orchestration and releasing enterprise APIs for AI platform integration.

### **5. Technical Implementation Details**

#### **Example: From Simple to Evolved Prompt for AI Agents**

**AI Agent Input**: "create a user profile component"

**Generic AI Output**: Basic React component with name and email fields

**vhybZ Evolved Prompt**: 
```
Create a Next.js 14 user profile component using:
- Server component with client-side avatar upload using uploadthing
- Prisma schema: User model with id, email, name, avatar, bio, createdAt
- Form validation with react-hook-form and zod schema
- shadcn/ui Card, Avatar, Button, Input components
- Optimistic updates with useTransition for bio edits
- Image optimization with next/image for avatar display
- Accessibility: proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- Error boundaries for upload failures
- Skeleton loading states during data fetch
```

The evolved prompt contains specific libraries, patterns, and architectural decisions that produce production-ready code instead of toy examples when consumed by AI coding agents.

#### **Conceptual Synapse Schemas**
```python
class PromptEvolutionRequest(bittensor.Synapse):
    """Validator → Miners: Full stateful task context."""
    project_id: str
    project_history: Optional[List[Dict]]  # Past architectural decisions
    current_context: Dict  # Raw prompt + code context from AI agent
    # Miner populates:
    evolved_prompt: Optional[str]  # The expert-infused prompt
    confidence_score: Optional[float]

class PromptJudgingTask(bittensor.Synapse):
    """Validator → Apex: Evolved prompt evaluation request."""
    original_prompt: str  # What the AI agent originally asked
    evolved_prompt: str  # What the miner produced
    project_context: Dict  # For context-aware scoring
    evaluation_rubric: List[str]
    # Apex populates:
    score: Optional[float]  # 0-100
    reasoning: Optional[str]
```

## **Part IV: Competitive Positioning: The Crowdsourced Cognitive Core**

vhybZ doesn't compete with AI coding assistants like Devin, Cursor, or Claude Code. We're creating the **crowdsourced cognitive core** that **makes them all better**. We're not replacing AI coding agents; we're the decentralized brain that guides them with expert prompts.

The race for LLM "cognitive core" is underway - lightweight models that sacrifice encyclopedic knowledge for capability. They live always-on as the kernel of LLM personal computing. While these cores excel at reasoning and tool-use, they lack the domain expertise that separates good code from great code. vhybZ becomes the crowdsourced expertise layer that fills this gap.

Unlike monolithic cognitive cores trained once, vhybZ's expertise evolves continuously through competition. When your on-device coding agent needs to implement authentication, it doesn't just reason about generic patterns - it taps into the collective wisdom of experts who've solved this exact problem across thousands of different architectural contexts.

| Factor | Walled Garden AI Coding Tools | **vhybZ Protocol** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Function** | **Execution Engine:** Generate code based on prompts. They are the "hands." | **Prompt Evolution:** Transform vague requests into expert-level prompts for AI agents. We are the "expertise layer." |
| **Source of Expertise** | **Centralized & Static:** Single proprietary "master prompt" from in-house teams. Generic, one-size-fits-all. | **Decentralized & Dynamic:** Competitive market of thousands of specialized miners whose expertise constantly evolves. |
| **Memory Model** | **Session-based:** Forgets everything between sessions. No persistent context. | **Persistent ProjectID:** Complete architectural history across all sessions, enabling compound learning for AI agents. |
| **Extensibility** | **Fixed toolset:** Cannot dynamically integrate new capabilities. | **MCP Integration:** Can recommend and orchestrate infinite tool expansions for AI platforms. |
| **Economic Model** | **Subscription/Usage fees:** Pay the platform, get generic service. | **Merit-based rewards:** Best evolved prompts earn most, creating quality pressure that benefits all AI agents. |

## **Conclusion: AI Coding's Missing Infrastructure**

The rise of AI coding agents represents a fundamental shift in how software gets built. But current AI systems fail by providing generic, context-blind suggestions. vhybZ fills this gap by creating the first market where expertise evolves prompts specifically for AI consumption.

Our impact extends beyond individual AI platforms. As AI coding agents commoditize code generation, the ability to guide them with expert prompts becomes the key differentiator. By decentralizing this expertise layer, we ensure that innovation accelerates, quality rises through competition, and access democratizes - any AI coding agent can tap into world-class expertise.

The future isn't about AI replacing developers. It's about AI agents orchestrating better code through increasingly sophisticated prompts. vhybZ provides the crowdsourced cognitive core to make those prompts as good as they can possibly be.
